---

## **Phase 4: Optimization and Enhancements**
Polish the app for a professional finish.

### **Task 7: Reporting and Analytics**
- **Steps:**
  1. Add features for generating detailed financial reports.
  2. Provide insights (e.g., monthly spending trends).
  3. Create visualizations (e.g., pie charts for expenses, bar graphs for income).
- **Goal:** Help users make informed decisions with data.

---

### **Task 8: Multi-Currency and Localization**
- **Steps:**
  1. Add support for multiple currencies.
  2. Localize the app for different regions (languages, date formats, etc.).
- **Goal:** Make the app accessible to a broader audience.

---

## **Phase 5: Deployment**
Make the app production-ready.

### **Task 9: Transition to PostgreSQL**
- **Steps:**
  1. Replace SQLite with PostgreSQL.
  2. Test migrations and update connection strings.
  3. Optimize database queries for performance.
- **Goal:** Scale the app for production.

---

### **Task 10: Frontend Enhancements**

  2. Add client-side validation and interactivity.
  3. Polish the UI/UX for a professional look.
- **Goal:** Improve usability and aesthetic appeal.

---

### **Task 11: Deployment**
- **Steps:**
  1. Deploy the app to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean).
  2. Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
  3. Implement monitoring tools (e.g., logging, performance tracking).
- **Goal:** Ensure the app is robust and reliable in production.

---

## **How to Work on Each Task**
1. **Divide into Sprints:** Treat each task as a sprint (e.g., 1â€“2 weeks).
2. **Iterate:** Begin with the simplest version of each feature and improve it over time.
3. **Test Each Feature:** Write unit tests for models and routes.
4. **Document:** Keep documentation for your models, API endpoints, and workflows.
