# Features to Add for Backend Developer Skills

## 1. Pagination for Expense List
- **What to Learn**: Handling large data sets and implementing efficient SQL queries.
- **How**: Use Flask-SQLAlchemy `paginate()` method to break expenses into pages.

---

## 2. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- **How**:
  - Create API endpoints (e.g., `/api/expenses`) to create, read, update, delete expenses.
  - Return JSON responses with status codes.
  - Use Flask's `Blueprint` for API routes.

---

## 4. Add Unit Tests and Integration Tests
- **What to Learn**: Test-driven development (TDD) using `pytest` or `unittest`.
- **How**: 
  - Write test cases for routes, database models, and edge cases.
  - Mock external email sending APIs like SendGrid.

---

## 5. CSV Export and Import for Expenses
- **What to Learn**: File handling, generating reports, and validating input.
- **How**: 
  - Add functionality to export expenses to a CSV file.
  - Allow users to upload CSV files to bulk import expenses.

---

## 6. Secure Password Reset with Expiry
- **What to Learn**: Token-based workflows, security with expiration, and hashing.
- **How**: 
  - Use the `TimedSerializer` from `itsdangerous` or `jwt`.
  - Ensure reset tokens expire after a specific time.

---

## 7. Logging for Debugging and Monitoring
- **What to Learn**: Proper logging using Python's `logging` module.
- **How**:
  - Add logs for critical operations like user login/logout, errors, and expense modifications.
  - Integrate tools like Sentry for error tracking.

---

## 8. Email Notifications
- **What to Learn**: Asynchronous task execution with Celery or RQ.
- **How**: 
  - Send emails for actions like adding an expense, reaching a monthly limit, or account updates.

---

## 9. Add API Rate-Limiting
- **What to Learn**: Security and performance optimization.
- **How**: Use `Flask-Limiter` to control API requests per user/IP.

---

## 10. Add Monthly Budget Tracking
- **What to Learn**: Complex calculations and data aggregation.
- **How**: Allow users to set a budget and track how much is spent monthly.

---

## 11. Switch to PostgreSQL (From SQLite)
- **What to Learn**: Working with production-ready databases.
- **How**: 
  - Replace SQLite with PostgreSQL.
  - Learn how to configure `SQLAlchemy` to work with PostgreSQL.

---

## 12. Dockerize the Application
- **What to Learn**: Deployment, containerization, and understanding Docker.
- **How**:
  - Write a `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yml` file.
  - Run the application in a container locally.

---

## 13. Implement Caching with Redis
- **What to Learn**: Optimizing performance for repeated queries.
- **How**: 
  - Cache frequently accessed pages or data using Redis.

---

## 14. User Activity Logging
- **What to Learn**: Audit trails for security and debugging.
- **How**: Log user activities such as logins, password resets, and expense modifications.

---

## 15. Deploy the App to a Cloud Platform
- **What to Learn**: Real-world deployment experience.
- **How**:
  - Deploy the app to Heroku, AWS, or Render.
  - Use environment variables for production settings.

---

## Key Focus Areas:
1. **Performance**: Pagination, caching, and optimized SQL queries.
2. **Security**: Password hashing, RBAC, rate limiting, and token-based workflows.
3. **Testing**: Writing tests to ensure your code is robust.
4. **APIs**: RESTful API design and JSON handling.
5. **Scalability**: Docker, PostgreSQL, and Redis integration.
